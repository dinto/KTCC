1)team user uniqueness required
2)whenever players registration going on login button for team is hide (inform to them)
3)once team click start  bid then team will be inside bid competition
4)remove or add to bid details  bid_screen_new player if greater than 2    problem when admin refresh the screen




workflow:
Start Bid -> Bid_Screen_new_Player
next_player -> Bid_Screen_new_Player

Bid_Screen_new_Player : bucket>0 ,if yes then current player true for random number else -> save playersinfo to bid player model and  current player is false

bid screen : print all current player true



==============
sold :
check maximum bid point in team 


unsold:
save as admin in user not Team
remove that player from bid_bucket



logic: team can't reduce bid point
team add next bid point
