workflow:

next_player -> Bid_Screen_new_Player

Bid_Screen_new_Player : bucket>0 ,if yes then current player true for random number else -> save playersinfo to bid player model and  current player is false

bid screen : print all current player true



==============
sold :
check maximum bid point in team 


unsold:
save as admin in user not Team
remove that player from bid_bucket



logic: team can't reduce bid point
team add next bid point


rules:
player registration in particular time period
team points :50000
base value :1000

1000 to 3000 = 200 each adding
3000 to 10000 = 500 each
10000 above =1000 each 

icon player = 10000 hence maximum point become 40000
icon player before bid date




swap player if any required
minimum players 15

if 15 members in 1 team then admin can disallow for biding 

10 over each
